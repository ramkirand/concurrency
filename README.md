Printing Number Series (Zero, Even, Odd)
This problem is about repeatedly executing threads which print a specific type of number. Another variation of this problem; print even and odd numbers; utilizes two threads instead of three.

Problem
Suppose we are given a number n based on which a program creates the series 010203...0n. There are three threads t1, t2 and t3 which print a specific type of number from the series. t1 only prints zeros, t2 prints odd numbers and t3 prints even numbers from the series
